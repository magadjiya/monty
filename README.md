# Monty Project

## Usage

To run the Monty project, use the following command:

```
./monty filename
```

Replace `filename` with the name of the file containing the Monty script.

The program reads the file line by line using `getline()` and executes instructions accordingly. It halts execution upon encountering an error.

## Functionality

The Monty project operates on stacks and queues, supporting the following opcodes:

- `push`: Adds an element to the stack.
- `pall`: Prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top.
- `pint`: Prints the value at the top of the stack.
- `pop`: Removes the top element of the stack.
- `swap`: Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
- `add`: Adds the top two elements of the stack.
- `nop`: This opcode does nothing.
